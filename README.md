## Comments
Custom JavaScript was used for the daily special. Custom jQuery used for accordion menu. 2 jQuery plugins I have not used on previous projects included Backstretch and the Hamburger menu. I also used a Smooth Scroll plugin.

I went through many iterations of certain sections in this site and in hindsight I wish I planned it out a little more before beginning. I think having a starting site from Project 2 made me want to jump right in, but I ended up redoing a lot of sections before I was satisfied.

I enjoyed working on this project, but did feel a little restricted by the required category types and content. In hindsight, I wish I clarified the instructions a little bit before beginning so I could have added the content I really wanted to have in there.
